name: Azure user viewed CosmosDB connection string
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when a user successfully requests to view a CosmoDB connection string through the Azure API, as this could be exploited by an attacker to access or modify data in the CosmoDB database.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Azure CosmoDB logs where the event name is "MICROSOFT.DOCUMENTDB/DATABASEACCOUNTS/LISTCONNECTIONSTRINGS/ACTION" and the outcome is "Success".

  ## Triage and response
  1. Verify that the user should be viewing the connection string for the specified CosmoDB database.
  2. If the activity is not expected, investigate the activity related to the CosmoDB.
