name: Azure AD Login Without MFA
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when any user logs in to Azure AD without multi-factor authentication.

  ## Strategy
  This rule monitors Azure Activity logs for Active Directory and detects when the event category is "SignInLogs" and the authentication requirement is "singleFactorAuthentication."

  ## Triage and response
  1. Reach out to the user to confirm if the login was legitimate.
  2. If legitimate, request the user enable 2FA.
  3. If not legitimate, rotate the credentials.
  4. Review all user accounts to ensure MFA is enabled.
