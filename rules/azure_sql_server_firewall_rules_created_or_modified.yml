  Detect when an Azure network security rule has been created, modified, or deleted.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Azure activity logs for events where the event name is either:
  - NETWORKSECURITYGROUPS/SECURITYRULES/WRITE
  - NETWORKSECURITYGROUPS/SECURITYRULES/DELETE

  and the outcome is Success.

  ## Triage and response
  Inspect the security rule to determine if it exposes any Azure resources that should remain private.
