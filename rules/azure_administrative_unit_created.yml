name: Azure administrative unit created
description: |-
  ## Goal

  Detect the creation of Administrative Units (AUs) in Entra ID (Azure AD), which may indicate suspicious activity if AUs are not being utilized.

  ## Strategy

  Monitor Azure Active Directory logs for events categorized as Administrative Unit and where the event name is "Add administrative unit," excluding restricted administrative units.

  ## Triage and response

  1. Review if the organization uses administrative units.
  2. Investigate any anomalous activity associated with the user creating an administrative unit.
  3. Determine if there is a legitimate reason for the user's action in creating an administrative unit.
