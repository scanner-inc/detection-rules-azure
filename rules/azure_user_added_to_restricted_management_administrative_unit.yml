name: Azure user added to restricted management administrative unit
description: |-
  ## Goal

  Detects the addition of Entra ID (Azure AD) users to restricted management Administrative Units (AUs). Restricted AUs limit modifications to members by users without specific role assignments. Adding a user to a restricted AU can jeopardize user containment during sensitive incidents and may suggest malicious activity.

  ## Strategy

  Monitor Azure Active Directory logs for events related to Administrative Units categorized as "Add member to restricted management administrative unit" that involve a restricted administrative unit.

  ## Triage and Response

  1. Confirm if restricted administrative units are utilized by the organization.
  2. Investigate any anomalous activity related to the user being added to the restricted administrative unit.
  3. Assess if there is a valid reason for the user's addition to the restricted administrative unit.
