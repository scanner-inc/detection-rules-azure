name: Azure Service Principal was assigned a role
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect an Azure service principal being assigned an Azure role.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Azure Activity logs for the following operations:

  - Event name: "MICROSOFT.AUTHORIZATION/ROLEASSIGNMENTS/WRITE"
  - Request body includes: "Service Principal"

  ## Triage and response
  1. Verify the legitimacy of the activity by investigating the:
    * Source IP of the activity
    * User who made the request
    * Role that was assigned to the application or service principal.
  2. If the user should not be assigning this Azure role and the service principal should not be assigned this role:
    * Revoke access of compromised credentials.
    * Remove unauthorized app registration or service principal.
    * Investigate other activities performed by the source IP.
    * Investigate other activities performed by the user.
