name: Azure AD sign in from AzureHound default user agent
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when the default user agent "AzureHound" is seen in Azure AD sign-in logs.

  ## Strategy
  This rule monitors Azure AD sign-in logs for the default user agent "AzureHound," a data collector for Bloodhound, an Active Directory reconnaissance tool that reveals hidden relationships and identifies attack paths within an AD environment. It is associated with MITRE ATT&CK and linked to various threat groups.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Determine if your organization has authorized the use of Bloodhound.
  2. If the triage indicates that this tool is unauthorized, initiate your company's incident response process and investigation.
      * If necessary, disable the affected identity and revoke any sign-in sessions.
      * Investigate any actions taken by the identity during the identified time frame.
