name: Azure snapshot export URI created
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect if an Azure snapshot is exported, as the export URLs are accessible to anyone with the link.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Azure logs where the event name is "MICROSOFT.COMPUTE/SNAPSHOTS/BEGINGETACCESS/ACTION" and the outcome is "Success".

  ## Triage and Response
  1. Verify the snapshot has a legitimate reason for being exported.
  2. If the activity is unexpected, investigate the IP address that created the export URL.
