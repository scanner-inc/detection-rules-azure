  Detect when a diagnostic setting is deleted, which can disable centralized logging and metrics on Azure.

  ## Strategy
  Monitor Azure logs where the event name is "MICROSOFT.INSIGHTS/DIAGNOSTICSETTINGS/DELETE" and the outcome is "Success".

  ## Triage and response
  1. Inspect the diagnostic setting resource found in the resource ID.
  2. Verify the user to determine if the removal of the resource is legitimate.
