description: |-
  ## Goal

  Detect the removal of Entra ID (Azure AD) users from restricted management Administrative Units (AUs), which are designed to protect certain users from being modified by unauthorized personnel.

  ## Strategy

  Monitor Azure Active Directory logs for events related to removing members from restricted management administrative units.

  ## Triage and response

  1. Check if restricted administrative units are in use by the organization.
  2. Investigate any suspicious activity for the user being removed.
  3. Assess if there is a valid reason for the user's removal from the restricted administrative unit.
