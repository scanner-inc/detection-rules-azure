name: Azure Network Security Group Open to the World
description: |-
  ## Goal
  Detect when an Azure network security group allows inbound traffic from all IP addresses.

  ## Strategy
  This rule monitors Azure Activity logs for network changes and detects when the event name is `MICROSOFT.NETWORK/NETWORKSECURITYGROUPS/WRITE`, the direction is `Inbound`, the access is `Allow`, and the source address prefix is either `0.0.0.0/0` or `*`.

  ## Triage and response
  1. Inspect which Virtual Machines are associated with this security group.
  2. Determine whether this security group and the VMs should permit inbound traffic from all IP addresses.
